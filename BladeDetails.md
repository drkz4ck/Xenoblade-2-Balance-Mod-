# Rare Blade Improvements
These are listed roughly from worst to best according to the "Official Community Blade Tier List" videos in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxTTNkdGoNpoFeHTkje_172d7mNYg7-y-)

**General changes:**
- Nerfs avoided as much as possible. The focus is to improve lesser blades. Broken Blades will be forever broken
- [ ] Aggro Up Blade art activates more often and draws more aggro
- [ ] Aiming to improve aggro reduction skills; If they really can't be helped, then changing them altogether
- [ ] BitBall Blades, except for Crossette, now have a party-wide buff or support skill
- [ ] Added +1000% to counterspike skills, making them more useful and relevant

### #0 Pyra
**Status**
- [x] Aux Cores Slots:~~2~~ 3
- [x] phys def ~~5%~~ 10%
- [x] ether def ~~10%~~ 15%
  - She has a hard time dealing with aggro. Increased defenses mitigate that and also reflect on her Super Smash Bros. persona

**Battle Skills**
- [x] **Purifying Flames**: Effect change
  - I particularly never noticed if it made any difference during playthrough
  - ~~Specials have a chance to instakill common enemies with 20%HP or less Specials have a chance~~ Specials have a chance to purge enemy rage status
    - 60% chance (Lv.1) â†’ 100% chance (Lv.5)
- [x] **Resplendence**: blade combo damage increase. Scales from +24% to ~~+72%~~ +100% 
- [x] **Flame Edge**: critical damage increase. Scales from +10% to ~~+50%~~ +65%.

**Specials**
- [x] **lv.1 Flame Nova**: ~~Hits a single target~~ a 5-5m AoE around the user
- [ ] **lv.2 Prominence Revolt**: 
- [x] **lv.3 Blazing End** ~~+25%~~ +30% crit chance
- [x] **lv.4 Burning Sword**: ~~+20%~~ +25% crit chance
- [x] **lv.4-EX Union Sword**: Now deals the damage of both blades' lv.4 Special (~~1500~~ 1150+1150 = 2300 damage)
### #0.1 Pneuma
- [ ] Thinking of increasing her activation timer from 60s to at least 90s, maybe even more, as in BoC difficulty she's much harder and less rewarding to pull off

## =E Tier=
### #51 Electra
**Status**
- shield hammers improved overall
- [ ] Aux cores 1 > 3

**Battle Skills**
- [ ] Sparky Girl: counterspike ether damage 400% > 1400%
  - Attempt to make spikes more useful
- [ ] Zappy Girl: increases aggro every second 30/s > 175/s

**Specials**

### #50 Dromarch
- [ ] Aux Cores 1 > 3
- [x] Twin Rings have faster attack speed and less art cooldown on Nia, as an attempt to make dromarch relevant
- [ ] Celestial Gift: Reduces Blade Combo damage received by 50%.
  - Replace skill? Very situational and not very useful

### #49 Finch
- shield hammers improved overall
- [ ] Aux Cores 1 > 3
- [ ] Did I do That? chance of activation 20% > 30% 
  - Making the skill more exploitable
- [ ] Doesn't Ring a Bell chance of activation 50% > 70%
  - Cirsctumstances in which the skill is useful are very strict; makes sense that they have a higher chance of activation
- [ ] Replace Surprise skill. Maybe a damage additive?
  - Only useful for the very first attack of a battle, if the enemy doesn't spot you

### #48 Kora
- [ ] Aux Core 2>3
- [ ] Stop Thinking: Enemies stop acting for some time after being hit with a special; Duration 3s>
  - 3s is too short of a time to be really useful
- [ ] Walking Joy: Heals when moving;
  - replace with Potion Hoarder? healing when moving is not very useful, because you cannot attack then

### #47 Godfrey
(I'm very excited about this one)
- shield hammers improved overall
- [ ] Aux Cores 1 > 3
- [ ] Got Guts: takes 36% less dmage at low HP; 30% and lower > 50% and lower (I increased the threshold for it to not conflict whith his healing passive, that normaly  activates at the same HP percentage and because being at low HP is too dangerous)
- Fierce Fervor: damage increase against higher level enemies 80% > 130% (he needs a damage boost, and at just conditional 80% it's hard to keep up with other blades)

## =D Tier=

### #46 Floren
- Aux Cores 2 > 3
- *Coming of Spring 25% > 50%
- White Lillies (aggro reduction) replaced; thinking of Headwind (20% dmg reduction for the party)*

### #45 Vess
- phys def 0% > 5%
- *Space Tea Time 20% > 30%
- *Not the Plan 15% > 25%
- *Sympathy change it for something else*

### #44 Dahlia
*Not sure what to do with her yet

### #43 Ageon
- Aux Cores 2> 3
- *someway to help him draw and keep aggro

### #42 Ursula
- Aux Cores 1>3
- Snow Charm: party wide-shield at max affinity; Shield damage 60% Max HP> 100% Max HP (This is all she's got going for her, and it's mostly only activated once per battle)
- *Hide and Seek (aggro reduction)

### #41 Boreas
- Aux Cores 1>3
- *some way to keep more aggro/more damage

### #39 Kassandra
- *more aggro/s
- *Calamity 30%>50%
- *Special 3 Secret Desire 30%HP>50%HP

### #38 Perdido
- Aux Cores 2>3
- physical and ether defenses 5%>10%
- improved attack speed (detailed in weapon section, his main gimmick is improved auto attacks, so I thought a nudge in that direction would make him more relevant)
- reduced art cooldown  (as is it's just way too high)

## =C Tier=
### #37 Cressidus
- *+crit rate
- *Trespass increased damage
- *Senton: works only on specials? verify ; consider improving topple time increase 

### #36 Perun
- Silent Spear (aggro reduction) replaced for Swift Kitty (+45% auto-atk speed); (original doesn't sinergize at all with her main gimmick, which is solo battling, and she needs an edge to be useful both solo and in-party)
- *Defender 40%HP>50%HP

### #35 Obrona
*Not sure what to do with her

### #34 Poppi alpha
- improved atk and art animations
- reduced art cooldowns (She is a great blade, but suffered from the same main problem as the shield hammers)

### #33 Perceval
- Aux Cores 1>3
- *Not sure what to do. I could either make him even more powerful in multi enemy battles or give him something to be useful against a single enemy
- *Increased damage agains humanoids is pretty useless

### #32 Poppibuster

### #31 Roc
- improved art recharge rates
- *phys def 5% >
- *ether def 5% >
- *Sickle 40% > 60%
- *Storm and Stress: increases damage at the start of battle for 30s. I'm thinking of either greatly increasing that time or replacing it for an entirely differnt skill for more damage relevance

### #30 Nia
- +10% atk speed (makes her auto-attack heal more relevant)
- +25% art animation speed (her arts are just too damn slow)
- Sea of Plenty activates more often
- Insta Regen recovers damage upon getting hit; chance 25% > 37,5%

### #29 Sheba
- physical defense 5% > 10%
- *Financial Settlement (aggro reduction) replace with another skill

### #28 Theory
- Aux Cores 2 >3
- Aerial Flashdance physical counterspike damage 400% > 550% (attempt to make counterspikes relevant at all)
- Conviction - Damage dealt to enemies targeting user increase 50% > 70% (She struggles to keep aggro because of low damage output, so this should solve both problems)

### #27 Praxis
- Aux Cores 1>2
- *Dexterity mod is useless due to The Awakened (Skill) (+50% acc at max affinity); Change her mod?
- *accuracy Up blade art is useless due to same reason; Change blade art?
- *Special 3 has increased damage from the side. If the payer has aggro it's useless; Find a way to decrease her aggro
- *too outclassed by many atk blades. How to make her more relevant?

### #26 Newt
- Aux Cores 2
- *No damage increasing skills
- *struggles to keep aggro
- *party wide 40% phys damage reduction; increase?

### #25 Gorg
- Aux Cores 2>3
- *FAS is too situational
- *increase party buffs slightly?

### #24 Vale
- *Void Lance increases damage from the side. Find a way to reduce her aggro
- *Specials 1 and 4 have increase damage at 30% health or less. Increase to 50% health?

## =B Tier= (need less improvements, really hard to come up with what to improve on them)

### #23 Agathe
- *replace party damage buff with weaker kaiser zone? or increase it's value
- *bad blade arts?
- *insect advantage is very situational
- *has many damage increases agains toppled enemies. Captalize on that?

### #22 Azami
- Aux Cores 2
- Pain for Longing: affinity increase when teammate takes damage; At high trust ranks and setups such as hunter's chemestry, affinity maxes out almost instantly so this has little to no usefullness
  - Thinking of changing it to something that boosts defense at lower HP values, to make her main skill more exploitable
- Vendetta ether spike damage: 300%>450% (trying to make counterspikes more relevant)

### #21 Sever
- Special 3 Effect overlaps with his battle skills
- Heartless Kill: +400% damage on a surprise attack; same problem as finch's skill
- I'm not sure yet, but it seems Armor Pierce and Nullify Defense do the exact same thing

### #20 Poppi QT
- Flash Counter: phys damage counterspike: 320%> 470% (trying to make counterspikes more relevant)
- outside of that, not sure what to do with her

### #19 Akhos
This guy's pretty solid, not much I can do for him
- reduce driver art cooldowns a little bit

- Wild Familiars: +80% damage to beasts; Would be nice to change that into something that improves her fusion combo niche role
- Look into "Ultimate Combo" Special for common blades 

### #17 Mikhail
- Improve critical rates

### #16 Wulfric
Aux Core 2>3
- phys def 5% > 
- ether def 5% >

### #15 Brighid

- 

### #13 Adenine
- Aux Cores 2>3
- Special 1 bonus effect
  - 40% aggro reduction > restores 50% of damage dealt to the whole party, same as nim's; This offers her some healing capability besides just spawning potions)
