## Improved Weapons
**Shield Hammers**

All Drivers:
Hammers now might be faster than the monado, but they really needed some buffs to be even viable. Monado comes with lots of other numerous advantadges over the hammer, so I think it's still in a very good spot.
- [x] auto atks 1 and 2 have 25% faster animations
- [x] auto atk 3 has 30% faster animations
- [x] 20% faster Arts animations
  - This might mean the shield art ends sooner; unsure
- [x] art cooldowns at lv 1 reduced; keeping level progression
  - 14>11; 12>9; 11>8 and 8>6
- [x] Auto atk 1 damage increase 50 > 65
  - auto atk 2 is still a 60% increase and auto atk 3 still a 50% increase (104 and 156, respectively)
- [x] Damage values of Fiora's Knives; min from 16 to 18 and max from 738 to 826
- [x] Critical Values of  Ether Cannons; min from 1 to 3 and max from 10 to 20
  - Higher damage, but lower crit rate than the chroma katana
- [ ] Additional Weapon Effect, up to debate

**Twin Rings (And Clones)**

Twin Rings and their clones are improved specifficaly for Nia, as an effort both to make Dromarch more relevant for her and Nia a more balanced Driver, with more solid weapon types to choose from.

Twin Rings, Infinty Fans, Brilliant TwinBlades, Knives and Dual Swords for Nia:
- [x] 20% Faster auto atks
  - Obrona becomes a speed demon on Nia

  - Butterfly Blade, Swallowtail and other Break arts
  - Jaguar Slash, Cheetah Scratch, Scarecrow, Avian Spin and Sword Slap

  - AoE that hits ahead: unchanged
  - other art, that hits a single enemy: -2 at lv.5

**Catalys Scimitar**

These modifications are part of an effort to make Blade-Nia more interesting to use. Auto attacks speed is to capitalize on her heal on auto atk skill, and arts were just too damn slow, specially compared to other options. Check more details on Blade-Nia changes on the Blade Section.
  - [x] 20% faster auto-attack animations
  - [x] faster art animations
    - 30% for water flower
    - 25% for all others  

**Drill Shield**

Drill Shield suffers a similar problem that Hammers do, that is slow animations. Drill Shields need much less improvements all around because of Poppi's is highly customizable
