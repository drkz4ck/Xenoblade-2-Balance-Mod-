## Improved Weapons
**Shield Hammers**

Hammers now might be faster than the monado, but they really needed some buffs to be even viable. Monado comes with lots of other numerous advantadges over the hammer, so I think it's still in a very good spot.
- [x] auto atks 1 and 2 have 25% faster animations
- [x] auto atk 3 has 30% faster animations
- [x] 20% faster Arts animations
  - This might mean the shield art ends sooner; unsure
- [x] art cooldowns at lv 1 reduced; keeping level progression
  - 14>11; 12>9; 11>8 and 8>6
- [x] Auto atk 1 damage increase 50 > 65
  - auto atk 2 is still a 60% increase and auto atk 3 still a 50% increase (104 and 156, respectively)
- [x] Damage values of Fiora's Knives; min from 16 to 18 and max from 738 to 826
- [x] Critical Values of  Ether Cannons; min from 1 to 3 and max from 10 to 20
  - Higher damage, but lower crit rate than the chroma katana
- [ ] Additional Weapon Effect, up to debate

**Twin Rings**

Twin Rings are alerady a solid weapon type, with many clones/reskins. These modifications are part of an effort to make Dromarch a more interesting Blade for Nia. These changes  affect common blades as well, so they can't achieve that goal by themselves.
- [x] 20% Faster auto atks on Nia
- [x] 25% Faster arts on Nia
  - Butterfly Blade
  - Jaguar Slash
- [x] Lower cooldowns on Nia, keeping cooldown reduction progression
  - Butterfly Blade 14 > 10 at lv.1
  - Jaguar Slash 11 > 9 at lv.1
  - Healing Halo 14 > 11 at lv.1

**Catalys Scimitar**

These modifications are part of an effort to make Blade-Nia more interesting to use. Auto attacks speed is to capitalize on her heal on auto atk skill, and arts were just too damn slow, specially compared to other options. Check more details on Blade-Nia changes on the Blade Section.
  - [x] 20% faster auto-attack animations
  - faster art animations
    - [x] 30% for water flower
    - [x] 25% for all others  

**Drill Shield**

Drill Shield suffers a similar problem that Hammers do, that is slow animations. Drill Shields need much less improvements all around because of Poppi's is highly customizable
  - [x] 20% Faster auto atk and art speed
  - Art Cooldowns reduced by 1
    - [x] Sppining Cutter has an actual cooldown progressn: lv.1 = 7 ; lv.5 = 5

**Mecha Arms**

Made the weapo a little faster, as an effort to make Poppi qT more relevant.
- [x] 25% Faster auto atk speed
- [x] 30% Faster art animations for booming buster and dented shield 

**Dual Scythes** 
- Reduced Art Cooldowns
  - [x] Vortex Edge, Muscle Slash and Muscle Uppercut Reduced by 1
  - [x] Mega Muscle Unchanged 
  - [x] All others Reduced by 1

**Bitballs**
- not sure yet what to do with this yet

**Decimation Cannon**

Faster attacks will captalize on perdido's main gimmick, and also differentiate him a bit from ether cannons.
- [x] Faster auto atk speed
    - +20% on auto atk 1 and 2, +10% on auto atk 3 
- Lower art cooldowns, mabe?
